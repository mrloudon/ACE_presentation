    "In the following example data was recorded from the **zygomaticus** and **corrugator** muscles.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as the two data channels, eight channels are used for *event marking*. Each time\n",
    "a stimulus appears the event marker channels are briefly pulsed with a pattern of highs and lows identifying what *type* of trial it is. The highs and lows can be considered to be 1's and 0's and can thus be interpreted as a binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a screen shot of some raw Biopak data. The two EMG channels are clearly visible at the top (red and blue traces).\n",
    "The eight marker channels are labelled **m_1, m_2, m_4, m_8, m_16, m_32, m_64, m_128** corresponding to their binary position. For example, the first visible event has **m_1**, **m_8** and **m_16** high and the other markers are low so this event type code in decimal is:  ```1 + 8 + 16 = 25```.\n",

These post-stimulus measurements can then be normalised by dividing by the baseline (absolute EMG voltages can vary widely for many spurious reasons and are not terribly useful in isolation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMG typically samples at 1kHz across 10+ channels so it is easy for a single subject to generate 50-100MB of data. The two data files we are about to analyse are about 70MB each.\n",

    "To automate the process I have written a Python module whose main purpose is to analyse a list of subject files against a *configuration file*. Every experiment is different and requires a configuration file to tell Python what channel is used for what purpose, what the event codes are, what intervals to use, what the sampling rate was, etc. the good news is that we just learned about Python lists and dictionaries and that is how the [configuration file](http://it053760:8888/edit/EMG/config/malc.json) works. \n",
